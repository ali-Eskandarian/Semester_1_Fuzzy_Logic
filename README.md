# Semester 1: Fuzzy Logic

## Repository Overview

This repository contains projects and implementations from the **Fuzzy Logic** course, completed as part of my Master's in Artificial Intelligence. Each project explores different techniques and applications of evolutionary computation, ranging from function approximation problems to advanced regression models using fuzzy logic.

## Projects Included

The repository is organized into the following projects, each implemented in its respective folder:

### 1. **Function Approximation**
   - **Description**: Solves a fuzzy-based interpolation problem.
   - **Objective**: Find the best fuzzy control fit to the training data.
   - **Key Techniques**: Ridge Regression, Least Square, TSK Fuzzy.

### 2. **Regression**
   - **Description**: Implements a Fuzzy Rule Based System to predict output of non-linear system.
   - **Objective**: Minimize the RMSE across the test cases.
   - **Key Techniques**: Provide Fuzzy sets type 1 & 2 in different categories and setting.

Each folder contains:
- Source code (`.py` or other relevant files)
- Input datasets (if applicable)
- Outputs or results (e.g., plots or logs)
- A brief README file explaining how to run the project (if needed)
